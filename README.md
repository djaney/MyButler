# MyButler
play around with python speech recognition and generation. Try to create a sensible bot that responds to natural language commands.

Note: I tried to put this on docker but I'm having issues with the sound. So for now, just look at the Dockerfile and install the requirements yourself.


## Todo
1. Push to talk
1. group tasks into packages so that I will only have to add packages instead of each individual task.

## setup
1. setup google cloud credentials for speech
1. set environment variable `OPENWEATHERMAP_KEY` for weather api key from openweathermap.org
1. set environment variable `SQS_URL` for notification queue
1. set environment variable `SQS_REGION` for notification queue

## commands
1. what's the weather 
1. what's the weather today
1. what's the weather later
1. what's the weather tomorrow
1. what's the time
1. open google
1. what is %search string%
