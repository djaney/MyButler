# MyButler
play around with python speech recognition and generation. Try to create a sensible bot that responds to natural language commands.

Note: I tried to put this on docker but I'm having issues with the sound. So for now, just look at the Dockerfile and install the requirements yourself.


## Todo
1. Custom text-to-speech using a real voice
1. Create tasks using IFTTT
1. Recieve IFTTT notifications
